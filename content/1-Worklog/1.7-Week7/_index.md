### Week 7 Objectives:

- Strengthen hands-on experience with Amazon DynamoDB, covering foundational operations, advanced modeling techniques, and multi-region architectures.
- Configure identity federation, IAM roles, and cross-platform cost optimization between AWS and Azure AD.
- Deploy and operate applications using Lightsail, container services, Step Functions, and secure IAM role-based access.
- Utilize Cloud9, Elastic Beanstalk, and CI/CD pipelines to automate application delivery.
- Enhance AWS security maturity through IAM fundamentals, monitoring controls, incident handling, and infrastructure defense.
- Build and automate microservices architectures with Lambda, DynamoDB, Step Functions, and CodeStar.

### Week 7 Achievements:

- Developed deeper DynamoDB expertise by creating tables, managing GSIs and composite keys, enabling backups, and processing Stream and Kinesis-enabled data pipelines.

- Utilized performance analysis and cost review techniques using DynamoDB metrics, Glue crawlers, and Athena queries, including applying cost tagging strategies.

- Configured IAM federation and governance:

  - Set up Azure AD federation, synchronized IAM roles, and tested console access.
  - Created IAM users, groups, and roles with IP-based and time-restricted conditions.

- Optimized AWS spending and performed database migrations using Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, Schema Conversion Tool, and AWS DMS with monitoring and serverless migration options.

- Managed application deployments using Lightsail instances and container services, including WordPress, Prestashop, Akaunting, snapshots, alarms, and custom Docker images.

- Built application workflows and secure access patterns:

  - Implemented Step Functions workflows using Task, Choice, Wait, Retry, Catch, and Parallel states.
  - Compared IAM access keys vs IAM roles and assigned an EC2 role for secure S3 access.

- Worked with Cloud9 and Elastic Beanstalk across the application lifecycle, from development to deployment using CodeStar, CodeCommit, and CodeDeploy.

- Strengthened organizational security posture:

  - Improved root account security, enabled MFA, and created a delegated IAM admin group.
  - Established password policies, evaluated SCPs, and employed IAM Access Analyzer and last-accessed reports.

- Built serverless microservices and applied security guardrails by developing Lambda-based services with DynamoDB and Step Functions, automating through CodeStar, and deploying GuardDuty, Security Hub, Detective, VPC security layers, WAF, Shield Advanced, Macie, KMS, ACM, and Secrets Manager.
