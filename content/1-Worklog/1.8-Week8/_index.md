### Week 8 Objectives:

- Apply Infrastructure as Code practices using AWS CloudFormation to deploy, enhance, and scale application environments.
- Strengthen application reliability with resiliency testing, Auto Scaling configurations, and automated recovery strategies.
- Design and secure modern application architectures, including authenticated serverless SPAs with performance tracing.
- Explore AI, storage, and content delivery services such as Amazon Polly, Rekognition, Lex, S3, and CloudFront.
- Monitor workloads through CloudWatch dashboards on various operating systems and prepare for the weekly assessment.

### Week 8 Achievements:

- Strengthened Infrastructure as Code skills using CloudFormation by deploying foundational and multi-tier architectures, then expanding them with S3 buckets, additional EC2 instances, and multi-region stacks.
- Improved knowledge of application resiliency and scaling:
  - Used AWS FIS to run controlled failure experiments and study system behavior.
  - Implemented Auto Scaling with load balancers, launch templates, and automated recovery.
- Successfully transformed application architecture:
  - Decomposed a monolithic system into microservices (Advert, Invoice, ShoppingCart, Order, User, Static) and validated the ecosystem.
  - Built and deployed a serverless SPA with API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and a CodeStar pipeline.
  - Added Cognito-based authentication and used X-Ray for request tracing.
- Explored AI and content delivery capabilities:
  - Integrated Polly, Rekognition, and Lex into practical scenarios.
  - Hosted and secured a static website on S3 while accelerating delivery via CloudFront; practiced versioning and cross-region replication.
- Enhanced monitoring expertise by creating CloudWatch dashboards and analyzing performance of both Windows and Linux instances under simulated load.
- Completed the weekly assessment covering reliability, serverless, AI services, and monitoring.
