### Week 9 Objectives:

- Design and integrate conversational and event-driven workflows using Amazon Lex and Amazon SNS.
- Work with managed NoSQL and in-memory data services including DynamoDB and ElastiCache, and automate deployments for workloads running on EKS.
- Apply scalability and governance principles through Service Quotas, IAM policy-based controls, and EKS Blueprints.
- Develop and operate both serverless and container-oriented applications, and analyze storage behavior across S3 and EFS.
- Implement S3 security protections and build an initial data lake pipeline leveraging Glue, Athena, and QuickSight.

### Week 9 Achievements:

- Designed messaging and conversational workflows by configuring a Lex chatbot, implementing Lambda-based fulfillment, and creating an SNS publish/subscribe ecosystem with several subscriber services.

- Worked with DynamoDB and Redis-based caching:

  - Practiced table operations, GSI usage, CloudShell operations, and Python-based access.
  - Created and connected to Redis clusters and performed operations such as strings, hashes, pub/sub, and streams.

- Automated EKS workload deployments by building clusters, setting up IAM roles, and creating CI/CD pipelines that trigger deployments from source changes.

- Applied governance and usage controls:

  - Evaluated and updated Service Quotas to support capacity needs.
  - Enforced IAM-based restrictions for Region, EC2 family/size, and EBS volume types.

- Used EKS Blueprints and IaC to prepare networking, configure cluster permissions, manage team-level access, deploy add-ons, and deploy workloads using ArgoCD.

- Designed and tested application architectures:

  - Built a serverless app using Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Amplify, and CodeCommit, including ride-time processing and image-processing flows.
  - Transitioned a monolithic workload into microservices deployed on Fargate with an ALB and ECS.

- Analyzed storage performance by evaluating S3 transfer patterns, small-file performance, and EFS tuning options including IOPS, I/O size, sync frequency, and multi-threading.

- Strengthened S3 security posture using encryption enforcement, public-access blocking, VPC Endpoint restrictions, and validation tools like AWS Config and Access Analyzer.

- Built a simple data lake solution using S3, DataBrew, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight for transformation, querying, and visualization.
