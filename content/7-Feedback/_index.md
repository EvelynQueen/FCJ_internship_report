### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very welcoming and transparent. FCJ members are always ready to support me whenever I face challenges, even beyond regular working hours. The workspace is neat and pleasant, helping me stay focused. Still, I believe adding more team bonding or social activities could help strengthen connections.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor gives very thorough instructions, clarifies concepts when I’m confused, and encourages me to ask questions. The admin team helps with administrative procedures, provides necessary documents, and ensures I have what I need to work efficiently. I especially value the mentor’s approach of letting me attempt to solve issues independently rather than offering the final answer immediately.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The tasks assigned fit well with what I learned in university while also introducing areas that were new to me. This helped me reinforce my fundamentals while expanding my practical experience.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
Throughout the internship, I picked up many new skills including using project management tools, collaborating effectively in a team, and communicating professionally in a business environment. The mentor also shared practical industry insights that supported my long-term career planning.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is highly positive: everyone treats each other respectfully, maintains professionalism, yet keeps the work environment enjoyable. During urgent tasks, all members join efforts and support one another regardless of their role. This made me feel included as part of the team, even as an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company offers an internship allowance and allows flexible working hours when needed. Additionally, access to internal training sessions is a valuable benefit.
